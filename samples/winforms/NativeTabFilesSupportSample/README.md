# Native Tab File Support Sample for WinForms

### Description

One of the most exciting new features in MapSuite 5.0 is native TAB file support. In the past, the FDO extension was used for displaying TAB files in MapSuite. Now with the new TabFeatureLayer, we have a simpler and more stable method of working with TAB files. 

This Code Community project demonstrates how to load and display a TAB file using the new TabFeatureLayer. The example also allows you to add, edit and delete features from the TAB file.
