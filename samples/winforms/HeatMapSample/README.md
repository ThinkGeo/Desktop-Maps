# Heat Map Sample for WinForms

### Description

Heat maps is a technique increasingly used in various fields such in biology and other fields. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map. They are also used for displaying areas of webs page most frequently scanned by users. http://csscreme.com/heat-maps/.

At ThinkGeo, we are taking this concept to GIS and applying it to geographic maps. Heat maps are a great way to give the users a visually compelling representation of the distribution and intensity of geographic phenomenon. 

Please refer to [Wiki](http://wiki.thinkgeo.com/wiki/map_suite_desktop_for_winforms) for the details.

### Requirements
This sample makes use of the following NuGet Packages

[MapSuite 10.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=ThinkGeo)

### About the Code
```csharp
ShapeFileFeatureSource featureSource = new ShapeFileFeatureSource("../../data/swineflu.shp"); 

HeatLayer heatLayer = new HeatLayer(featureSource);
//Creates the HeatStyle to set the properties determining the display of the heat map with earth quake data.
//Notice that each point is treated with an intensity depending on the value of the column "other_magn1".
//So, in addition to the density of points location, the value for each point is also going to be counted into account
//for the coloring of the map.
HeatStyle heatStyle = new HeatStyle();
heatStyle.Alpha = 255;
heatStyle.PointRadius = 100; 
heatStyle.PointRadiusUnit = DistanceUnit.Kilometer;
heatStyle.Alpha = 180;
heatStyle.PointIntensity = 10; 
heatStyle.IntensityColumnName = "CONFIRMED";
heatStyle.IntensityRangeStart = 0;
heatStyle.IntensityRangeEnd = 638;

heatLayer.HeatStyle = heatStyle;
```
