# Download Source code
1. We've hosted the source code on github at [https://github.com/howardchn/Sample-HeatMap-WLM.git](https://github.com/howardchn/Sample-HeatMap-WLM.git). clone the repository to local by:
	```perl
    git clone https://github.com/howardchn/Sample-HeatMap-WLM.git
    ```
    On the other hand, you can download it as zip via click the clone or download button shown in following screen shot.
