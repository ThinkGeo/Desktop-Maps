# Shapefile Encryption Sample for WinForms

### Description

In todayâ€™s project, we are looking at a way to encrypt shapefiles to prevent them from being used outside the application. We show how to encrypt and decrypt shapefiles using streams. You will see that a very simple encryption algorithm is used but by looking at the example, you will be able to implement your own.

Disclaimer: This encryption system can be used only on small shapefiles due to the amount of memory used. A typical use would be to encrypt some valuable small shapefiles you don't want your users to access. In the future, Map Suite will provide a full encryption system as an API.

Please refer to [Wiki](http://wiki.thinkgeo.com/wiki/map_suite_desktop_for_winforms) for the details.
