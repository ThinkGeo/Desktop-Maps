# Intersect Line Sample for WinForms

### Description
In todayâ€™s project, we show how to split a line based on an intersecting line. To accomplish this task, basically two steps are needed. First, you need to find the crossing point using the GetCrossing function and then you split the line based on the crossing point using the GetLineOnLine function. If you are in the utilities industry working with electric network, gas pipes etc, you will find this project useful.

### Requirements
This sample makes use of the following NuGet Packages

[MapSuite 10.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=ThinkGeo)

### About the Code
```csharp
LayerOverlay layerOverLay = (LayerOverlay)winformsMap1.Overlays[1];
MapShapeLayer mapShapeLayer = (MapShapeLayer)layerOverLay.Layers[0];

LineShape lineShape = (LineShape)mapShapeLayer.MapShapes["Line1"].Feature.GetShape();
LineShape lineShape2 = (LineShape)mapShapeLayer.MapShapes["Line2"].Feature.GetShape();

MultipointShape multipointShape = lineShape.GetCrossing(lineShape2);

LineShape splitLineShape1 = (LineShape)lineShape.GetLineOnALine(StartingPoint.FirstPoint, multipointShape.Points[0]);
LineShape splitLineShape2 = (LineShape)lineShape.GetLineOnALine(StartingPoint.LastPoint, multipointShape.Points[0]);
```
