# Distance Query On Projected Layers Sample for WinForms

### Description
This sample shows how to use the method GetFeaturesWithDistanceOf when the data is projected. We just input the unit which is projected to, do not need to mind what the real unit is for the internal data before projection.  It works fine with Map Suite Assemblies 4.5.54.0 or later.

Please refer to [Wiki](http://wiki.thinkgeo.com/wiki/map_suite_desktop_for_winforms) for the details.
