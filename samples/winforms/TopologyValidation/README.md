# Topology Validation Sample for WinForms

### Description

Starting with version 6.0.113.0, Map Suite includes topology validation capabilities. This Topology Validator sample application makes it simple to visualize and test topology rules. You simply select the case you want to test, use our drawing tools to create the shapes necessary, and then hit the play button to run the test. The error cases are highlighted on the screen and saved to the test, and their Well-Known Text (WKT) is copied to your clipboard. At any time, you can view or edit the WKT which makes up the case. We save our test cases as XML files that contain not only the test case features but also the errors. This makes it a snap for you to share your cases with us or other colleagues. 

For more details including a list of topology cases that you can test, see [this article](http://gis.thinkgeo.com/Support/DiscussionForums/tabid/143/aff/16/aft/10443/afv/topic/Default.aspx#topology) or watch the [video overview](http://youtu.be/IuLGTRsVtQc)
