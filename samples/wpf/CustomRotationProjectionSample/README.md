# Custom Rotation Projection Sample for Wpf

### Description
In todayâ€™s project, we show how to create your own projection class that allows projecting a layer from any internal projection to any external while doing a rotation at the same time. Having the capability to apply those two operations in one step may come handy if the original layer was created in a different projection with the north at an angle and you want to align it on the base map.

Please refer to [Wiki](http://wiki.thinkgeo.com/wiki/map_suite_desktop_for_wpf) for the details.

### Requirements
This sample makes use of the following NuGet Packages

[MapSuite 10.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=ThinkGeo)

### About the Code
```csharp
class CustomRotationProjection : Projection, IDisposable
{
    protected override Vertex[] ConvertToExternalProjectionCore(double[] x, double[] y)
    {
        //First, converts to the external projection
        Vertex[] projVertices = new Vertex[x.Length];
        proj4.Open();
        for (int i = 0; i < projVertices.Length; i++)
        {
            projVertices[i] = proj4.ConvertToExternalProjection(x[i], y[i]);
        }
        proj4.Close();

        Vertex[] rotateVertices = new Vertex[x.Length];

        //Second, rotates based on angle and pivot point.
        for (int i = 0; i < rotateVertices.Length; i++)
        {
            rotateVertices[i] = RotateVertex(projVertices[i].X, projVertices[i].Y, angle);
        }

        return rotateVertices;
    }
}
```
