# Nautical Charts Viewer Sample for Wpf

### Description
ThinkGeo Nautical Charts is a standalone Nuget Package which works with ThinkGeo 10.X Desktop/Web products. It reads and displays S-57 Electronic Navigational Charts(ENC) from International Hydrographic Organization(IHO), it also reads the style info defined in an S-52 file. 

This sample happens to be written for WPF but the Nautical Charts Package works for Web project as well. Download and open it in Visual Studio, hit F5 and Bang, you are good to go. After you have the charts viewer running, use File -> Open to load an S-57 data, (it can be downloaded from NOAA’s website), the nautical charts will then appear on the map (it generates an index file the first time the data is loaded). 

ThinkGeo uses a default style which can be easily modified. Nautical Charts Viewer provide the ability to switch the map between 5 modes: Day Bright, Day Black, Day White, Dusk and Night. It has 3 verbose mode of “All”, “Standard” and “Base”. It can switch boundaries between dashed line and triangles, it can show/hide different labeling, show different languages, etc. If you are a developer, dig in the code and you can see it’s as simple as creating a layer and set up the properties like following, and it can do more than it shows in this sample
