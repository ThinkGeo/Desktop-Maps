Numerous platforms and gas and oil well structures exist in the Gulf of Mexico from Key West, Florida to Brazos Santiago, Texas. Some wells are submerged and capped. Only those structures reported submerged and covered less than 20.1 meters / 11 fathoms are charted outside of the 18.2 meter / 10 fathom curve. See ENCs in the 1:400,000 / US2 scale range and 1:80,000 / US4 scale series ENCs for location of surface platform structures and wells submerged 20.1 meters / 11 fathoms or more, submarine pipelines and cables, aids to navigation and safety fairways through operational oil field areas.
