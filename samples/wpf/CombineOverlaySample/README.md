# Combine Overlay Sample for Wpf

### Description

In todayâ€™s Wpf project, we show a technique of using a common FeatureSource for two different Overlays. From a physical shapefile representing cities, a regular LayerOverlay is used for the higher zoom levels while a FeatureSourceMarkerOverlay is used for the lower zoom levels. FeatureSourceMarkerOverlay is a Wpf specific overlay offering features for a better user experience such a Tooltips and ImageSource.
