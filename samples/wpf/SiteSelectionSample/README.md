# Site Selection Sample for Wpf

### Description
The Site Selection sample template allows you to view, understand, interpret, and visualize spatial data in many ways that reveal relationships, patterns, and trends. In the example illustrated, the user can apply the features of GIS to analyze spatial data to efficiently choose a suitable site for a new retail outlet.

### Requirements
This sample makes use of the following NuGet Packages

[MapSuite 10.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=ThinkGeo)

### About the Code
```csharp
Proj4Projection projection = new Proj4Projection();
projection.InternalProjectionParametersString = Proj4Projection.GetBingMapParametersString();
projection.ExternalProjectionParametersString = Proj4Projection.GetEpsgParametersString(4326);

featureSource.Open();
projection.Open();
pointShape = projection.ConvertToExternalProjection(pointShape) as PointShape;
Feature feature = featureSource.GetFeaturesNearestTo(pointShape, geographyUnit, 1, ReturningColumnsType.NoColumns)[0];
PolygonShape polygonShape = routingEngine.GenerateServiceArea(feature.Id, new TimeSpan(0, tempDrivingTimeInMinutes, 0), 100, GeographyUnit.Feet);
polygonShape = (PolygonShape)projection.ConvertToInternalProjection(polygonShape);
```
