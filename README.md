# [Bread Crumb Trail Sample for WinForms](https://gitlab.com/thinkgeo/public/thinkgeo-desktop-maps/-/raw/support/v10/samples/winforms/BreadCrumbTrailSample/)
An early project of the Code Community, “Vehicle Direction”, showed how to rotate the icon of a moving vehicle based on the direction. In today’s project, we are going one step further and we are showing how to display dynamically a bread crumb trail as a trailing tail behind the moving vehicle. For this purpose, we are creating a new LineShape with the latest points at every new position.
